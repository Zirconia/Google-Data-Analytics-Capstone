# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone

## Overview

This case study was done for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program on Coursera. It details my findings for track A case study 1, "How does a bike-share navigate speedy success". In this study, I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analytics team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago.The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. The following deliverable requirements are listed in the instructions:

1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis


## Business Task

Determine how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to develop marketing strategies for converting casuals to members.
